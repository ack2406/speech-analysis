# Potential Analysis Functions for Speech Frequency Analysis

This document lists potential analysis functions that could be implemented to study speech frequency characteristics in different languages. Each function is intended to explore specific aspects of speech frequency and could provide insights into the unique frequency ranges of various languages.

## Analysis Functions

- [ ] **Pitch Analysis**: Analyze the fundamental frequency (F0) across different languages to study pitch variations. This can include:

  - Calculating the average pitch.
  - Analyzing pitch range and contour over time.
  - Comparing pitch statistics between languages and genders.

- [x] **Formant Analysis**: Analyze the formant frequencies (F1, F2, F3) to understand vowel space differences in various languages. This could include:

  - Extracting formant frequencies for all vowels.
  - Plotting formant frequencies in a 2D vowel space.
  - Comparing formant frequency patterns across languages and genders.

- [ ] **Spectral Band Analysis**: Divide the speech signal into different spectral bands (bass, mid, treble) and analyze the energy distribution in these bands. This analysis can include:

  - Measuring the energy in each spectral band.
  - Analyzing how energy distribution varies across languages.
  - Comparing energy distributions between male and female speakers.

- [ ] **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) Analysis**: Extract MFCCs to study the speech features that are most prominent in different languages. This could include:

  - Extracting MFCCs from speech recordings.
  - Visualizing MFCC patterns over time using spectrograms.
  - Comparing MFCC patterns between languages to identify unique speech characteristics.

- [ ] **Harmonic-to-Noise Ratio (HNR) Analysis**: Measure the harmonic-to-noise ratio to evaluate voice quality and clarity. This analysis can include:

  - Calculating HNR across different speech samples.
  - Analyzing how HNR varies across languages and phonemes.
  - Visualizing HNR distributions for different speakers and languages.

- [ ] **Temporal Dynamics Analysis**: Analyze temporal aspects of speech, such as speaking rate, syllable duration, and pause duration. This can help understand:

  - How temporal speech patterns differ across languages.
  - The impact of speaking rate on frequency characteristics.
  - Comparing speaking rate and pause patterns between different languages.

- [ ] **Sibilant Frequency Analysis**: Study the frequency characteristics of sibilant sounds (like 's' and 'sh') in different languages. This could include:

  - Extracting sibilant sounds and analyzing their frequency spectra.
  - Comparing the peak frequencies of sibilants across languages.
  - Analyzing the distribution of sibilant frequencies for male and female speakers.

- [ ] **Phoneme Frequency Analysis**: Analyze the frequency characteristics of specific phonemes (like vowels and consonants) in different languages. This analysis can include:

  - Extracting specific phonemes and analyzing their frequency spectra.
  - Comparing phoneme frequency characteristics between languages.
  - Studying how phoneme frequencies vary with different accents or dialects.

- [ ] **Prosody and Intonation Analysis**: Examine prosodic features such as intonation, stress, and rhythm in different languages. This can include:
  - Analyzing pitch contour and stress patterns.
  - Comparing intonation patterns across languages.
  - Studying rhythm and stress variations in speech.

## Instructions for Implementation

1. Select an analysis function from the list above.
2. Create a new Python file in the `individual_analyses` directory named `<your_analysis_name>_analysis.py`.
3. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file within the `individual_analyses` directory to implement the analysis.
4. Once implemented, check the box next to the corresponding function above.

Feel free to propose additional analysis functions by editing this document or creating an issue in the repository.
